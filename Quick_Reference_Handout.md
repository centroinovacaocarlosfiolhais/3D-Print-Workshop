# 3D PRINTING QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
**For Teachers | Keep This Handy!**

## ✓ GOLDEN RULES FOR 3D DESIGN

### Size & Thickness
- **Minimum wall thickness**: 2mm
- **Small details**: Keep above 3mm
- **Typical classroom object**: 30-80mm
- **Quick print size**: Under 50mm per side

### Angles & Overhangs
- **Safe overhang**: 0-45° (no support needed)
- **Risky overhang**: 45-70° (may need support)
- **Impossible**: 70-90° (definitely needs support)

### Print Orientation Matters!
- Put largest flat surface on the bed
- Minimize overhangs by rotating
- Think: "What side sits on the table?"

## 📏 COMMON PRINT SETTINGS

```
Quick Reference:
├─ Layer Height: 0.2mm (standard)
├─ Infill: 15% (enough for most items)
├─ Print Speed: 50mm/s
├─ Supports: Auto-generate if needed
└─ Bed Adhesion: Brim for small items
```

**Print Time Estimate:**
- 3cm object ≈ 15-20 min
- 5cm object ≈ 30-45 min
- 8cm object ≈ 1-2 hours

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

| ❌ Don't | ✓ Do Instead |
|---------|-------------|
| Make walls <1.5mm thick | Use 2-3mm minimum |
| Forget support for overhangs | Check angles before printing |
| Design with parts "floating" | Connect everything to base |
| Make text too small | 8mm height minimum |
| Ignore print orientation | Rotate for best results |
| Design first, measure later | Check real-world size in mm |

## 🔧 QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING

**Print not sticking?**
→ Add a brim or raft in slicer

**Strings/cobwebs on print?**
→ Lower temperature by 5°C

**Print breaks easily?**
→ Increase wall thickness or infill

**Taking too long?**
→ Reduce size or lower infill to 10%

**Model has errors?**
→ Use "Repair" in slicer software

## 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Start simple**: Master basic shapes before complex designs
2. **Test small**: Print 50% scale to test design (saves time!)
3. **Measure twice**: Use digital calipers if making functional parts
4. **Save often**: Tinkercad auto-saves, but export backups
5. **Join communities**: Reddit r/3Dprinting, Facebook groups
6. **Involve students**: Let them design, you supervise prints
