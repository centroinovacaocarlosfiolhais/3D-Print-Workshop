## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE

### Printer Issues
| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| Won't stick | Add glue stick, increase bed temp |
| Spaghetti | Stop, re-level bed, start over |
| Under-extrusion | Check if filament is loaded properly |
| Stringing | Lower temp 5°C |
| Layer shift | Check belt tension, slow down |

### Computer Issues
| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| Tinkercad won't load | Try different browser, use mobile device |
| Can't download STL | Check pop-up blocker, download to desktop |
| File won't import to slicer | Re-export from Tinkercad, check file size |
| Zoom too small | Use browser zoom (Ctrl +) |
| Lost work | Check "Designs" page in Tinkercad |

### Common Participant Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "I can't see my object" | Click "View Cube" home button |
| "How do I delete?" | Select object, press Delete key |
| "I grouped wrong things" | Ctrl+Shift+G to ungroup |
| "My text disappeared" | Check if it fell through workplane, use "D" to drop |
| "File too large" | Scale down in Tinkercad (each side <100mm) |

## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Manage Expectations:**
- Not everyone will finish the exercise - that's OK!
- Focus on learning process, not perfect results
- Emphasize that mistakes are part of design iteration

**Keep Energy Up:**
- Celebrate small wins ("Great, you grouped it!")
- Share interesting/funny prints you've seen
- Let participants see each other's screens
- Encourage helping neighbors

**Time Savers:**
- Have pre-made examples to show (don't design live for too long)
- Skip Onshape if running behind
- Use "follow along" teaching (everyone does same steps)
- Prepare a few designs to slice while they work

**Build Community:**
- Create WhatsApp/Slack group for participants
- Exchange contact info
- Plan follow-up meetup
- Share success stories after workshop
